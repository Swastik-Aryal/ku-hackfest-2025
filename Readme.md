# Feynman

Feynman is a specialized AI system built to help learners truly understand physics and mathematics. Instead of only producing final answers, it focuses on clear reasoning, transparent steps, and visual explanations that make complex concepts intuitive and trustworthy.

# System Architecture (High-Level Overview)

**User Input** The user begins by asking a question and selecting whether it belongs to physics or mathematics.

**Intelligent Routing**
An AI-based router analyzes the request and directs it to the appropriate domain-specific reasoning model. It also determines whether a visual explanation would improve understanding.

**Domain-Specific Reasoning**
Physics questions are handled by a model trained specifically on physics concepts and problem-solving methods.

Mathematics questions are handled by a separate model trained on mathematical reasoning and symbolic problem solving.

These models focus on step-by-step explanations, assumptions, and alternative solution paths rather than just final answers.

# Automatic Visualization (When Needed)

For concepts that benefit from visual intuition, the system generates animated explanations. These animations help users see how equations, graphs, or physical systems evolve.

# Reliable Output

If an animation fails to generate correctly, the system automatically corrects itself and retries, ensuring users receive clear and accurate visual explanations.
